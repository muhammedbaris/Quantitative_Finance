# 📈 QuantPM – Institutional Portfolio Management Simulator

**QuantPM** is a full-stack, institutional-grade portfolio management simulator designed for long-term capital allocators such as foundations, endowments, and family offices. It enables simulation, optimization, and evaluation of diversified, multi-asset portfolios that include public markets, private investments (VC, PE), hedge funds, and real assets.

The tool is built with the dual goals of:
- Enhancing **data-driven portfolio decision-making**
- Demonstrating technical and analytical capabilities for a quantitative analyst role

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📊 **Strategic Asset Allocation Simulator**  
  Monte Carlo engine for long-term capital projections

- 🔄 **Rebalancing Engine**  
  Simulate periodic or threshold-based rebalancing strategies

- 🧱 **Private Markets Module**  
  Model capital calls, NAV buildup, distributions, J-curves

- 📉 **Stress Testing Toolkit**  
  Run historical and synthetic shocks (e.g. 2008, COVID)

- 📐 **Performance Attribution**  
  Decompose returns by asset class, style, or strategy

- 🧠 **ESG & Custom Constraints**  
  Optional layer for integrating ESG-aware allocation logic

- 💻 **Interactive Web Dashboard**  
  React + Flask/FastAPI + PostgreSQL interface for real-time scenario analysis
